        The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
        smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
        proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
        electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="align-left">
        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.

        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already

        Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to
        turn the turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the

        Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate change.

        >
        has advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology
        is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the
        atmosphere. Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide
        at current rates – even just for the next 10 years – will create “a
        different planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide,
        repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously
        rising sea level.” The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs
        County would release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
        annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

        Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The
        county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. An experimental
        site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology to store carbon
        dioxide underground, is under construction in West Virginia near Meigs
        County's southern border. In addition,
        <u

        >
        have been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
        appear to be on hold. Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest
        counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a
        Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new plant,
        argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry. “When
        you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you can't speak
        out about it,” she says.

        In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
        millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
        manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
        the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these chemicals has been
        linked to human health problems, such as cancer, gastrointestinal
        disorders, impaired motor skills and neurological damage. Kent Carson, a
        spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said the proposed plant will
        use new technology to control pollutants. “This will be the cleanest
        facility of its type in the state,” he said.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
        problems of a particular individual. “We’re exposed to a soup of
        chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality at
        Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
        interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors. In
        addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
        correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are more
        likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than

          ></u
        >
        , compared to only about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio counties.
        Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably disperse
        most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it is impossible to
        know for sure what residents are being exposed to, because no agency
        monitors the county’s air.

      <b>So what do we know about air quality and health in Meigs County?</b>

    <div class="panel">

        An analysis by USA Today estimated that the air quality at Southern
        Elementary School in Meigs County is worse than the air quality at 97
        percent of the nation's schools. USA Today identified two of the coal
        plants near Meigs County as major contributors to pollution at the
        school. In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life expectancy
        among men in any Ohio county, according to data compiled by Harvard
        University (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties). Meigs County also
        has the highest death rate of any Ohio county for lung and bronchus
        cancer, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

        Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
        than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than 25
        percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office of
        Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's median
        income was $27,287, about half the national average. Many Meigs County
        residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring to the
        community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in favor of the
        plant at public hearings. “My family will benefit by me going up there
        and working,” he said. “If I reached in your pocket and took $200,000
        out of your pocket, would you like it?” he said, referring to the income
        he estimated he could earn during the four years it would take to build
        the plant. But no one can guarantee how many jobs will actually go to
        Meigs County residents or how much they will pay. “We all know that not
        all the workers are going to come from Meigs County,” said Sheets, the
        construction worker. “They’ll be from all over the country.”

        Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
        must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
        Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has
        received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant
        will start in late 2009 or early 2010. Opponents of the plant have
        appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow construction
        to proceed during the appeals process.
